# Titanic_Survallance_Prediction-Challenge-


A long time ago a tragical aciedent happend with the most big naive existed in the planet.
Unfortunally many people died in this acident, in the challenge we try to identify the most influence variable  for who died and build a model to predict who died in this acident.

A more descriptive about challenge is bellow:

"" The Challenge
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). ""

For this purpose we compared  and evaluated two classifier: Random Forest and decision tree.
So, once the best model found out we tunnelled the hyperparameter and then observe the improvement the model got.
