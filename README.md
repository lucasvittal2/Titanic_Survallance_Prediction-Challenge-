# Titanic_Survallance_Prediction-Challenge-


A long time ago a tragical aciedent happend with the most big naive existed in the planet.
Unfortunally many people died in this acident, in the challenge we try to identify the most influence variable  for who died and build a model to predict who died in this acident.

For this purpose we compared  and evaluated two classifier: Random Forest and decision tree.
So, once the best model found out we tunnelled the hyperparameter and then observe the improvement the model got.
